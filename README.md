# Kasa Vue App

# WORKS BEST ON LOCALHOST - IF USING HOSTED SITE TO VIEW, CLICK ON 'ABOUT' in FOOTER TO COME BACK TO INDEX PAGE. DID SOME LAST MINUTE RESTRUCTURING so nav links won't work properly

## Objectives (Functionality over Design)

SPA built with Vue + Nuxt using JSONbin.io for API.
Used Service Workers and Vanilla JS to Create PWA (Even though there is a workbox.js file in the build, workbox was not used)

Made to be Responsive. Hopefully there are no 'px' instead of 'em' or 'rem'. Tried my best to stay true to using relative lengths
