## Objectives (Functionality over Design)

SPA built with Vue + Nuxt using JSONbin.io for API.
Used Service Workers and Vanilla JS to Create PWA (Even though there is a workbox.js file in the build, workbox was not used)

Made to be Responsive. Hopefully there are no 'px' instead of 'em' or 'rem'. Tried my best to stay true to using relative lengths
